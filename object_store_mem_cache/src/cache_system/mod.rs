//! Cache System.
//!
//! # Design
//! There are the following components:
//!
//! - [`Cache`]: The actual cache that maps keys to [shared futures] that return results.
//! - [`Hook`]: Can react to state changes of the cache state. Implements logging but also size limitations.
//! - [`Reactor`]: Drives pruning / garbage-collection decisions of the [`Cache`]. Implemented as background task so
//!       users don't need to drive that themselves.
