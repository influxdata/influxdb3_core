//! Defines type aliases and helper functions involving `hyper`, `http`, `http_body`, and
//! `http_body_utils` for use in any other crate. Goals:
//!
//! - Reduce duplication
//! - Make upgrades of these http-related crates easier by having one place where definitions may
//!   need to be updated
//! - Make it easier to pass http-related types between crates
//!
//! This crate is lower-level than `iox_http`; this crate is meant to be more general-purpose and
//! `iox_http` is meant for services providing HTTP APIs.

// Workaround for "unused crate" lint false positives.
