# This crate is designed to be independent of the rest of the IOx
# server and specific storage systems such as Mutable Buffer and Read Buffer.
#
# The rationale for this is to:
#
# 1. Keep change/compile/link time down during development when working on just this crate
# 2. Allow for query logic testing without bringing in all the storage systems.
