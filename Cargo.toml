# Patching Arrow
#
# Assuming you have a local checkout of Arrow in a directory alongside your local checkout of influxdb3_core,
# and you have changes to Arrow in your local checkout that you want to test out with influxdb3_core,
# uncomment this `[patch.crates-io]` section to tell Cargo to use your local arrow versions for all
# transitive dependencies. The entries for the `arrow-*` crates are needed because `datafusion` has
# a direct dependency on them.
#
# WARNING: Do not merge in a PR uncommenting this change! This is for local testing only!
